# Ydenticon

## What's this about?

Given a piece of personal information such as an email address, IP address, 
or a public key, the program will generate a unique avatar. 
This package allows the generation of such avatars. GitHub recently used
such an approach and generates an identicon for all new users who don't 
have a gravatar account attached.
