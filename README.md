# AvatarMe

## Skills developed

* Hashing
* image manipulation

## Assigment

Given a personal information such as an email address, IP address, or a
public key, the program you will write needs to generate a unique avatar.
Imagine that you are building a new application and you want all of your
users to have a default and unique avatar. The package you will write
will allow the generation of sych avatars. GitHub recently used such an
approach and generates an identicon for all new users who don't have a
gravatar account attached.
